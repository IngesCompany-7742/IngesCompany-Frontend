# DoofPlus Web Application

Official implementation of the DoofPlus Web Application, built from the Figma mock-ups of the project report.

It follows the course base project (learning-center): Angular 22, Angular Material, ngx-translate (English and Spanish) and a fake REST API with json-server. Each bounded context has its own domain, pplication, infrastructure and presentation layers, and the shared base classes (BaseApi, BaseApiEndpoint, BaseAssembler, BaseForm) live in src/app/shared.

## Run

`ash
npm install
npm run server
npm start
`


pm run server starts the fake API at http://localhost:3000/api/v1 (data in server/db.json). 
pm start opens the app at http://localhost:4200/.

## Demo accounts

Every account uses the password DoofPlus2026! and the two-factor code 482106.

| User | Email | Environment |
|------|-------|-------------|
| María México · QA Specialist (release privilege) | maria.mexico@andinos.com.pe | QA/QC |
| Alberto Valle · Production Supervisor | lberto.valle@andinos.com.pe | Production |
| Carlos Medina · Administrator | carlos.medina@andinos.com.pe | Administration |

Signing in to an environment that does not match the role shows the "Access not authorized" state.

## Bounded contexts and routes

| Bounded context | Folder | Routes |
|-----------------|--------|--------|
| Identity & Access Management | src/app/iam | /sign-in, /sign-in/:environment (credentials, 2FA, not authorized), /administration/users, /administration/users/invite |
| Organizations & Profiles | src/app/organizations | /register (RUC already registered, verification), /administration/overview, /<environment>/profile |
| Subscriptions & Payments | src/app/subscriptions | /administration/subscription (declined payment, plan change review) |
| Manufacturing & Batch Management | src/app/manufacturing | /production/overview, /production/orders, /production/orders/:code, /production/products, /production/batches (batch not created), /production/batches/:code, /production/raw-materials |
| IoT Monitoring | src/app/monitoring | /production/iot, /production/equipment, /production/sensors/:code, /production/incidents, /production/batches/:code/iot |
| Quality & Compliance | src/app/quality | /qa/overview, /qa/indicators, /qa/documents (self-approval blocked), /qa/deviations, /qa/capa (root cause required), /qa/batch-release (release blocked), /qa/analytical-results, /qa/audits, /qa/regulatory-reports, /<environment>/audit-trail, /<environment>/tasks |

## Business rules implemented

- Two-factor code after the password; the environment is checked after the identity is verified.
- Separation of duties: the author of a document version cannot approve it; a CAPA owner cannot be its reviewer.
- A batch can only be created with a unique code and an approved master formula.
- Equipment that is not fit for use, or whose sensors feed another batch in progress, cannot be associated with a batch.
- An out-of-specification result requires a deviation; a deviation needs reviewed evidence before it is submitted.
- Batch release requires every readiness check and the re-entered password of a user with the QA release privilege. Every signature is recorded in the audit trail.
